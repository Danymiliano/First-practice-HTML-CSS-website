# First-practice-HTML-CSS-website

This is my <strong>first</strong> website where I started learning layout CSS and HTML tags.

It looks very simple, but you have to start somehow, right? :)

What knowledge did I gain from this project?

+ Basic knowledge of HTML
+ How to work with the browser console
+ How to work with the block and inline system using CSS
+ Flexboxes
+ All the basic CSS functions, including pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, how to apply effects to the entire page etc.
+ Semantic tags, the differences between them and divs and spans
+ A little about adaptive layout
